title: v0.4.0 - C2C Tags and Auth
author: Daniel Oaks
---
This is the fourth proper release of goshubnc! With this new version, prawnsalad brings external authentication methods (useful for plugging into existing systems), and we now support passing-through client-to-client tags if configured.

In addition, history can now be better replayed to multiple clients with the “passhistory” command, when you have your clients configured properly. This release makes it easier for both larger installs of goshubnc, as well as those who just have it installed on a little Raspberry Pi.

As always, you can download the new release [from Github](/) or with the links on the left. Make sure to review the changelog to view the new config changes you need to make!

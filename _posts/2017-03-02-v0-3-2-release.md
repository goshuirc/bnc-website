title: v0.3.2 - self-message patch fix
author: Daniel Oaks
---
With this release comes a fix! Specifically, under certain circumstances (which are very rare), messages sometimes fail to get passed to alternate clients. This release fixes this patch and adds some tests to ensure it doesn’t happen again!

This release requires no config changes from v0.3.0 or v0.3.1, so upgrade as soon as possible to make sure this doesn’t affect you!

New releases can be downloaded [from Github](/) or with the links on the left. If you’re upgrading from a pre-v0.3.0 version, checkout the changelog to see the new config changes.
